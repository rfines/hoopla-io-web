# Hoopla.io Website

## To Run for Development

 * npm install -g coffee-script
 * npm install -g brunch
 * cd hoopla-io-web
 * npm install
 * You'll need 2 terminal windows
 * In one, run 'brunch watch' - This will recompile the code on the fly
 * In the other run 'coffee app.coffee' - This will run the node.js server


## Running the tests
 Go here http://localhost:3000/client/test/  Pretty easy, huh?
